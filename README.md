# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Vehicle-Using-Wireless-Communication
- The objective of this project is to present the simple control method of robot which is hand gestured control. This main objective can be split into following distinct objectives.
- - To understand the role of accelerometer in controlling the robots using gestures.
- - To understand the wireless communication of human hands using RF transmitter & receiver pair and the role of Arduino micro-controller in driving the motors for controlling the robot car.

Technologies Used:
  - 
  - Language: C++
  - Simulation Platform: Arduino IDE
